# Machineer Data

This is an old repo I used for storing online data, like the version number, for my old game `Machineer`.\
I made it when I didn't really have many options for hosting, so I decided to keep it in a GitHub Repo.

## Archival

**I am now archiving this repo**, as I'm not actively working on the project and I'm not gonna use it anymore. I now know how to properly host it, and I have a few free hosting options available, just in case.

I am leaving this repo archived, not private, just in case so the game works properly if someone decides to play it for some reason.
